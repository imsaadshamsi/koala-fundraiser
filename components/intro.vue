		h2 Australia is in trouble
		p 12 million acres of land burned. 500,000,000 animal lives lost. At least 20 human lives lost. Over 1500 homes destroyed. Unthinkably poor air quality and smoke so severe that its made it all the way to New Zealand. And summer isnâ€™t even half over. 
		p Firefighters from around the world have been working day in, day out to battle these fires, but long periods of drought along with extreme temperatures are making this an incredibly difficult fight. In addition, animal hospitals and rescues have been working tirelessly around the clock to locate, treat, rehabilitate, and shelter wildlife that has been caught in these fires. One of the hardest hit species are koalas. Thousands of koalas have been killed so far in these fires and the numbers continue to rise. At this point, it is predicted that by 2050, koalas could be extinct due to these devastating fires.  

		h2 So, what can we do to help? 
		p We can raise funds which can be used to help in a variety of different ways. I have decided to sell prints of my photography with ALL proceeds being donated to both #[a(href="") NSW Rural Fire Service] and #[a(href="") Port Macquarie Koala Hospital]. These donations will help with things such as covering the extensive costs incurred fighting the fires, treatment and rehabilitation for the koalas, watering stations for surviving animals in areas decimated by fire, and projects aimed at regenerating the plant and animal life destroyed during these fires. 
		p Please see below for prints and print details, and feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
